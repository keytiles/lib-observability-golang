// This object is designed the way that it starts empty when created (has 0 Metric) and Metrics are getting created and exposed as you invoke it's methods. This is why it is "lazy".
// You can track how many times requests were sent, and how many times they succeeded / failed. You also have the possibility to track Request-Response loop times AND you can do it
// per each HttpSatatus codes/ Methods which brings pretty good observability just out of the box.
